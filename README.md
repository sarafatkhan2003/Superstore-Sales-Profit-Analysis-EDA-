## 📊 Key Analysis Highlights

### 🔹 Sales Trend Analysis
- Sales show a **steady upward trend** over the years
- Strong **seasonality**, with peak sales during **Q4 (Oct–Dec)**

### 🔹 Category Performance
- **Technology** is the most profitable and consistent category
- **Furniture** generates high sales but often results in losses

### 🔹 Regional Performance
- The **Central region** is overall loss-making
- Losses are largely driven by Furniture products

### 🔹 Discount Impact
- Discounts show a **negative correlation with profit**
- Heavy discounting reduces margins without proportional sales growth

---

## 💡 Key Insights

- 📈 Sales growth does not always translate into profit growth  
- 🪑 Furniture category requires pricing and cost optimization  
- 🌍 Region-specific strategies are necessary for profitability  
- 💸 Discount strategy needs tighter control  

---

## ✅ Business Recommendations

- Reduce excessive discounting on low-margin products  
- Focus growth initiatives on **Technology** category  
- Re-evaluate pricing, logistics, and promotions in the **Central region**  
- Leverage Q4 seasonality with better inventory and marketing planning
